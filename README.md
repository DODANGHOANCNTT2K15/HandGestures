# Hand Gesture Control
Control video with hand gestures via computer cam

## üìñ Introduction
This project uses a webcam and the Mediapipe library to recognize hand gestures, allowing you to control media functions such as play/pause (Space) and volume control on your computer. The program is written in Python, featuring a simple graphical interface and audio feedback.

## ‚ú® Features
### Media Control (Play/Pause - Space)
- **Activation:** Show both hands open, palms facing the camera, and hold for 1 second to toggle Space mode.
- **Execution:** When Space mode is active, make a fist (palm facing the camera) to send a Space or "K" key press (depending on the application).
- **Supported Applications:** YouTube, VLC, TikTok, Windows Media Player.

### Volume Control
- **Activation:** Show one hand making an "OK" gesture (thumb and index finger touching, other three fingers spread), hold for 0.5 seconds to toggle Volume mode. Plays a beep sound when toggling.
- **Increase Volume:** In Volume mode, right hand open and left hand in a fist ‚Äî increases volume by 5% every 0.5 seconds.
- **Decrease Volume:** Right hand in a fist and left hand open ‚Äî decreases volume by 5% every 0.5 seconds.
- **Technology:** Uses `pycaw` for precise volume control via Windows API.

### GUI and Feedback
- Displays webcam feed with hand landmark points (via Mediapipe).
- Shows real-time status: "Space Mode", "Volume Mode", and gesture information (Open, Fist, OK).
- Plays beep sounds (1000Hz when enabled, 500Hz when disabled) for toggle confirmation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
1. Run `main.py` to start the webcam interface.
2. Show your hand(s) in front of the camera and use the following gestures:
   - **Both hands open (1 second):** Toggle Space mode (Play/Pause control).
   - **Fist when Space mode is active:** Play/Pause the media.
   - **OK gesture (0.5 seconds):** Toggle Volume mode.
   - **Right hand open, left hand fist:** Increase volume.
   - **Right hand fist, left hand open:** Decrease volume.
3. Observe the on-screen status and listen for beep sounds.

## üìã Notes
- Ensure good lighting conditions for accurate gesture recognition.
- When Volume mode is enabled, Space mode is disabled to prevent conflicts.
- Volume changes by 5% every 0.5 seconds, without displaying a progress bar (handled via `pycaw`).
